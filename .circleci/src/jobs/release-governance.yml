Alongside the upcoming USDC support being launched, this reward type would match every USDC token spent by a fan on an artist's offerings with an AUDIO token for both fan and artist from the pre-existing rewards system (see here for more: https://blog.audius.co/article/proposing-audio-rewards-on-solana). It includes important sybil resistance mechanics and other functionality as well - we would encourage review of the codebase to fully understand it before placing a vote."
