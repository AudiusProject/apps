Always implement high quality production ready code that performs the requested task, using the requested tools, libraries, external systems, infrastructure etc. Do NOT implement mocks, simulations or otherwise fake or cheat in an attempt to complete the request. Do not update or delete unrelated code (this includes insertions, deletions, and additions).

If you find yourself doing something very unusual or inconsistent with the existing codebase, patterns and practices then stop and explain the situation to the user and confirm the course of action before proceeding, else, proceed as normal.
