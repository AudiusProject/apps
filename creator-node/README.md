An Audius Creator Node maintains the availability of creators' content on IPFS. The information stored includes audius user metadata, images, and audio content. The content is backed by either aws S3 or a local directory.

To add to the ContentBlacklist table, refer to the script `scripts/update-content-blacklist.sh`.

For detailed instructions on how to develop on the service, please see [The Wiki](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Creator-Node-%E2%80%90-How-to-run).
