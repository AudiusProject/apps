An Audius Creator Node maintains the availability of creators' content on IPFS. The information stored includes audius user metadata, images, and audio content. The content is backed by either aws S3 or a local directory.

For detailed instructions on the architecture of the system, please see [The Wiki](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Content-Node:-Architecture).
