# Setup Instructions

```
# initial setup
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/main/dev-tools/setup.sh" | bash

# refresh terminal for docker
exit
```
```
# build and run
audius-compose build # About 10 minutes
audius-compose up
```

## Resource Requirements

Increase `docker` resource allocations to avoid OOM kills and your local docker image repository running out of space.
Below are suggested minimum values.
```
Docker > Preferences > Resources > Advanced
- CPUs 4
- Memory 12 GB
- Disk Image Size 80 GB
```

If you still run into issues, you may execute a `docker system prune` to free additional space.

## Port Forwarding Instructions

To use the client from a mac, we need to setup a transparent proxy server to interact with the machine running the backend
```
brew install sshuttle
```

### Localhost

If running protocol and client on localhost

```
audius-compose connect
```

### Remote Machine

If running protocol on remote instance and client on localhost

```
audius-compose connect -r
```

Then on your local machine you can go to http://audius-protocol-discovery-provider-1:5000/health_check
