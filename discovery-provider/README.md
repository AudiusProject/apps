An Audius Discovery Provider is a service that indexes the contents of the Audius contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, for Audius users to query. The indexed content includes user, track, and album/playlist information along with social features. The data is stored for quick access, updated on a regular interval, and made available for clients via a RESTful API.

For detailed instructions on how to develop on the service, please see [The Wiki](http://localhost:1337/#running-for-development).
