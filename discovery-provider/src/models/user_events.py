    User events track event metadata a user may produce as a part of their interaction
    with the protocol over time, e.g. who was the user referred by? has the user signed in on a mobile app?

    Events are stored as a separate table from Users as it is assumed that the table of events
    will be fairly sparse as not all users will have produced all types of events.
    While a JSONB column in the User table would be sufficient for many event types, in order to query
    across all users that may or may not have produced a certain event, they are broken into separate fields.

    Future events may wish to take on the shape of JSONB data within the UserEvents table itself.
