The Audius API is entirely free to use. We ask that you adhere to the guidelines in this
documentation and always credit artists.

## Selecting a Host

Audius is a decentralized music streaming service. To use the API, you first select an API endpoint
from the list of endpoints returned by:

<Tabs
  block={true}
  defaultValue="request"
  values={[{"label":"Request","value":"request"},{"label":"Response","value":"response"}]}
>
<TabItem value="request">

```bash
GET https://api.audius.co HTTP/1.1
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="response">

`200: OK`

```json
{
  "data": [
    "https://audius-discovery-1.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-1.theblueprint.xyz"
    "https://audius-discovery-11.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-12.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-13.cultur3stake.com",
    ...
    "https://dn1.monophonic.digital",
    "https://dn1.nodeoperator.io",
    "https://dn1.stuffisup.com",
  ]
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

The Audius REST API lets you query, stream, and search for tracks, users & playlists across the
network.

Once you've selected a host, all API requests can be sent directly to it. We recommend selecting a
host each time your application starts up as availability may change over time.

## Specifying App Name

If you're integrating the Audius API into an app in production, we ask that you include the
`app_name` param with each query. Your unique app name is entirely up to you!

```bash
&app_name=<YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME>
```
