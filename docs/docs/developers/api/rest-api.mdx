The Audius API is entirely free to use. We ask that you adhere to the guidelines in this
documentation and always credit artists.

The Audius REST API lets you query, stream, and search for tracks, users and playlists across the
network.

## Selecting a Host

Audius is a decentralized music streaming service. To use the API, you first select an API endpoint
from the list of endpoints returned by:

### Request

```bash
GET https://api.audius.co HTTP/1.1
```

### Response

```json
{
  "data": [
    "https://audius-discovery-1.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-1.theblueprint.xyz"
    "https://audius-discovery-11.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-12.cultur3stake.com",
    "https://audius-discovery-13.cultur3stake.com",
    ...
    "https://dn1.monophonic.digital",
    "https://dn1.nodeoperator.io",
    "https://dn1.stuffisup.com",
  ]
}
```

Once you've selected a host, all API requests can be sent directly to it. We recommend selecting a
host each time your application starts up as availability may change over time.

## Specifying App Name

If you're integrating the Audius API into an app in production, we ask that you include the
`app_name` param with each query. Your unique app name is entirely up to you!

```bash
&app_name=<YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME>
```
