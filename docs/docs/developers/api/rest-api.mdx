:::info

This documentation is actively being developed. For additional details, refer to the original API reference at [https://audiusproject.github.io/api-docs](https://audiusproject.github.io/api-docs)

:::

The Audius API is entirely free to use. We ask that you adhere to the guidelines in this
documentation and always credit artists.

The Audius REST API lets you query, stream, and search for tracks, users and playlists across the
network.

## Selecting a Host

Audius is a decentralized music streaming platform. To ensure reliable API requests, use `api.audius.co` as the endpoint for all methods. This domain automatically routes traffic to healthy, available hosts for each request.

---

## Specifying App Name

When integrating the Audius API into a production application, include the app_name query parameter with each request. Choose a unique app name that identifies your application.

```bash
&app_name=<YOUR-UNIQUE-APP-NAME>
```
