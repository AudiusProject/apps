When delivering content to Audius, there are two options:

1. Run open source DDEX ingestion tooling yourself, starting
   [here](/distributors/self-serve/run-a-ddex-server).
2. Work directly with a partner that will accept standard DDEX XML files via private delivery (S3,
   SFTP) and upload releases to Audius

## Tiki Labs, Inc.

Tiki Labs, Inc., one of the development teams behind the Audius protocol, offers a first-party
