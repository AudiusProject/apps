## What is DDEX

Digital Data Exchange (or "DDEX") is an international standards-setting organization that was formed
in 2006 to develop standards that enable companies to communicate information along the digital
supply chain more efficiently by:

- Developing standard message and file formats (XML or flat-file)
- Developing choreographies for specific business transactions
- Developing communication protocols (SFTP or based on web services)
- Working with industry bodies to create a more efficient supply chain.
