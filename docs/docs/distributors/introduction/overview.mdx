Audius supports bulk content ingestion via the DDEX standard.

Providers, labels & partners with their own delivery infrastructure should reference the following
documentation for guidance on how to send and administer content on Audius.

:::tip Build it yourself

If you're looking to build your own ingestion tooling, get started with the [Audius SDK](/sdk).

## What is DDEX?

[Digital Data Exchange](https://ddex.net/),"DDEX", is an international standards-setting
organization that was formed in 2006 to develop standards that enable companies to communicate
information along the digital supply chain more efficiently

DDEX accomplishes this by:

- Developing standard message and file formats (XML or flat-file)
- Developing choreographies for specific business transactions
- Developing communication protocols (SFTP or based on web services)
- Working with industry bodies to create a more efficient supply chain

## How DDEX Works with Audius

The DDEX standard is a common language spec, in XML format, used to share releases, streaming, and
royalty data.

the same stack weâ€™re using to work with traditional distributors to get music on-chain.

Record Labels and other rights holders can work with their existing distribution pipelines pretty
seamlessly and get their tunes up on audius.

## Common Flow

> A User spends $5 for an album, collecting credits that can be exchanged back in a single
> transaction to send $USDC payments to the artist. Of that revenue, 90% is sent to the distributor,
> which manages the artist payout share async, and the remaining 10% flows to the Audius Governance
> system.

## Open Source

Audius has the first Open Source implementation of DDEX which allows users to permissionlessly stand
up ddex-compliant services and distribute music directly to Audius.

All DDEX ingestion code & libraries are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/audiusproject/ddex-processor).

You may clone and self-operate your own Audius compatible DDEX ingestion server, which provides a
web interface to deliver files, manage uploads, and track success. Under the hood, DDEX ingestion
uses the [Audius SDK](/sdk) to process and upload tracks and is available in a
[self-service](/distributors/self-serve/run-a-ddex-server) manner.

### Example Files

Example DDEX XML files are available on
[GithHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/ddex-processor/tree/main/fixtures).
