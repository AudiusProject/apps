Audius supports bulk content ingestion via the DDEX standard.

If you're looking to build your own ingestion tooling, get started with the [Audius SDK](../../developers/sdk/overview).

## What is DDEX

Digital Data Exchange (or "DDEX") is an international standards-setting organization that was formed
in 2006 to develop standards that enable companies to communicate information along the digital
supply chain more efficiently by:

- Developing standard message and file formats (XML or flat-file)
- Developing choreographies for specific business transactions
- Developing communication protocols (SFTP or based on web services)
- Working with industry bodies to create a more efficient supply chain.

## Open Source

All DDEX ingestion code & libraries are open source and available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/packages/ddex).

You may clone and self-operate your own Audius compatible DDEX ingestion server, which provides a web
interface to deliver files, manage uploads, and track success. Under the hood, DDEX ingestion uses
the [Audius SDK](../../dvelopers/sdk/overview) to process and upload tracks.
