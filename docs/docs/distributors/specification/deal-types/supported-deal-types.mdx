## Overview of Supported Deal Types

Audius accepts deals for
[**track**](/distributors/specification/deal-types/supported-track-deal-types) and
[**album**](/distributors/specification/deal-types/supported-album-deal-types) releases under a
range of commercial models. These are built around DDEX-defined `CommercialModelType` and `UseType`
combinations. Below is a breakdown of the deal types, structured to cover scenarios like free
streaming, pay-gated content, follow-gated access, and NFT-gated streams.

For clarity:

- **`CommercialModelType`**: Describes the overarching consumer model (e.g., "FreeOfChargeModel",
  "PayAsYouGoModel", or "UserDefined").
- **`UseType`**: Defines the usage mode (e.g., "Stream", "OnDemandStream", or "PermanentDownload").
- **`ValidityPeriod`**: Specifies time-based restrictions for the deal.
- **`TerritoryCode`**: Details the regions where the deal applies.
