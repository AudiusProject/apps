2. `/ReleaseList/Release/ReleaseDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/ReleaseDate`
3. `/ReleaseList/Release/GlobalOriginalReleaseDate`

#### coverArtFile

the `coverArtFile` maps to two DDEX Fields

- `/ResourceList/Image/ImageDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/TechnicalImageDetails/File/FilePath`
- `/ResourceList/Image/ImageDetailsByTerritory[TerritoryCode="Worldwide"]/TechnicalImageDetails/File/FileName`

:::info

this DDEX field is a relative path to the file within the delivery

:::

#### userId

### Optional Fields

The following fields are optional for content to be listed on Audius and are examined and pulled
from a DDEX delivery in cascading precedence.

`ProprietaryId`

communicated somewhere

never passed to Audius SDK because DDEX doesn’t provide these and likely never will

Audius and not used anywhere:

- `Title[@TitleType='DisplayTitle']/SubTitle`
