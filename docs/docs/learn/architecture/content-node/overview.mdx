An Audius Content Node is a service that stores and maintains the availability of all content across
the Audius network. Content types include user, track, and playlist metadata, images and artwork,
and audio content.

[github repository](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/tree/main/creator-node)

[registered content nodes](https://dashboard.audius.org/#/services/content-node)

## Design Goals

1. Surface the Audius Storage Protocol for storing and serving images and audio
2. Keep data consistently replicated and available
3. Provide an interface to handle content upload, transcoding, and identification
4. Allow users to maintain agency over where and how their data is stored amongst Content Nodes

:::note

The Content Node may be referred to as the Creator Node. These services are the same.

## Architecture

### Web Server

The Content Node's core service is a web server with an HTTP API to process incoming requests and
perform the following functions:

- user & track metadata upload
- user & track image upload
- user track file upload
- user & track data, metadata, and track file retrieval

_The web server is a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) [Express app](https://expressjs.com/)._

### Persistent Storage (Postgres)

It stores all data in a postgresql database and all images and metadata objects on its file system.

Pointers to all content and metadata stored on disk are persisted in the Postgres DB.

_Postgres is managed in the codebase using the [Sequelize ORM](https://sequelize.org/main/) which
includes migrations, models and validations_

### Redis

A [Redis client](https://redis.io/) is used for for resource locking, request rate limiting, and
limited caching and key storage.

_Redis is managed in the codebase through the [ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis) npm
package_

### Track Segmenting

As defined by the [Audius protocol](https://whitepaper.audius.co), the content node uses
[FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html) to segment & transcode all uploaded track files before
storing/serving.

### Data Redundancy

As defined by the [Audius protocol](https://whitepaper.audius.co), all content is stored redundantly
across multiple nodes to maximize availability. This is all done automatically - every node monitors
every other node in the network to ensure minimum redundancy of all data, transfering files as
required.
