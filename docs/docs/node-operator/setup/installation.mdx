:::caution Looking for Old Docs?

Please be aware that `audius-docker-compose` will soon no longer be supported.

This guide describes how to run Audius services on a single machine via Docker Compose. The
repository of Docker Compose files can be found on
[GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose).

On a VM that meets the minimum requirements from above run:

```bash
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AudiusProject/audius-docker-compose/main/install.sh)
```

During installation there will be prompts for required environment variables. The variables are:

---

**Creator Node**

- `creatorNodeEndpoint` - The DNS of your content node. If you haven't registered the service yet,
  please enter the url you plan to register.
- `delegateOwnerWallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered on chain,
  used to sign JSON responses from server
- `delegatePrivateKey` - Private key associated with `delegateOwnerWallet`
- `spOwnerWallet` - Wallet that registered (or will register) the content node on chain

If you're using an externally managed Postgres DB please see
[this section](/node-operator/setup/advanced#discovery-node)

---

**Discovery Node**

- `audius_delegate_owner_wallet` - Address of wallet that contains no tokens but that is registered
  on chain, used to sign JSON responses from server
- `audius_delegate_private_key` - Private key associated with `audius_delegate_owner_wallet`

If you're using an externally managed Postgres DB please see
[this section](/node-operator/setup/advanced#discovery-node)

## Quick Start

Installing and managing Audius Nodes is straightforward.

1. Install `audius-ctl` to your laptop.
2. Edit the configuration.
3. Run your Audius Nodes!

---

## Install `audius-ctl`

Get started by opening a terminal on your "Controller" machine, this can be any computer, such as a
laptop or desktop.

Run the following command to install the controller utility, `audius-ctl`

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.audius.org | sh
```

> checkout the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-d)

---

## Edit the Configuration File

Next you will need to edit the configuration file. Run the following command to get started:

```bash
audius-ctl config edit
```

### Config Template

The configuration file will be pre-populated with the required fields. Edit them to match your
configuration for each Audius Node you will be running.

```bash showLineNumbers
network:
  deployOn: mainnet
nodes:
  creator-1.example.com:        # <--- THE URL OF YOUR CONTENT NODE
    type: creator
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
  discovery-1.example.com:      # <--- THE URL OF YOUR DISCOVERY NODE
    type: discovery
    privateKey: abc123          # <--- UNIQUE PRIV KEY USED BY THIS NODE TO SIGN RESPONSES
    wallet: 0xABC123            # <--- UNIQUE WALLET ADDRESS OF ABOVE PRIV KEY
    rewardsWallet: 0xABC123     # <--- ADDRESS OF WALLET HOLDING STAKED TOKENS
```

---

## Run the Nodes

With the configuration file setup correctly, the final command to run is:

```bash
audius-ctl up
```

This command does a few things:

1. loops over every node specified
2. connects to each Virtual Machine via ssh
   1. checks that the required Audius Node software is installed
   2. if not found, runs the installer
   3. starts the Audius Node

Get help, and view all of the available commands by running the following command:

```bash
audius-ctl --help
```
