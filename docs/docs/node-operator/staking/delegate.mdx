## What is Delegating?

For users that either do not hold enough $AUDIO to self stake a Node, do not want to operate a Node,
or are just looking to get started, Delegation is a great place to get involved.

Delegating tokens earns rewards, and increases your ownership of the protocol while supporting Node
Operators, assisting in keeping them up and running, which in turns keeps the Audius protocol
healthy.

## Delegating on Audius

To stake on Audius, Node Operators can set up content and/or discovery nodes using
[these resources](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Staking-Resources).

:::info Active Node Operators

A list of all active Node Operators can be found under the
[Services tab](https://dashboard.audius.org/services) in the
[Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org/).

:::

$AUDIO holders can delegate a minimum of 100 tokens to any Node Operator by connecting to either
MetaMask or using a Gnosis Safe. Each Node Operator is also able to set a higher minimum delegation,
keep that in mind when evaluating which Node Operator you chose to delegate towards.

### Delegate with MetaMask

1. First sign in to your MetaMask account and connect to the
   [Audius Protocol Dashboard](https://dashboard.audius.org).
1. Select a Node Operator you would like to delegate toward and click the "Delegate" button.
1. Select the amount of $AUDIO to delegate and click the "Delegate" button.
1. Sign the transaction in MetaMask to complete the process.

## Cooldown Period

Audius features a 7 day cooldown period to undelegate in order to provide adequate time for Nodes to
be slashed in the event of malicious behavior.
