## What is Staking?

Built as a decentralized protocol on Ethereum, all the content, information and data on Audius is
stored and indexed by a growing network of third-party node operators, rather than by the Audius
team.

To ensure this content can be trusted and maintained, node operators are required to provide
collateral or ‘stake’ as a bond to service the protocol. This stake, denominated in $AUDIO, ensures
that node operators have tokens at risk that can be slashed, or taken, in the event of malicious or
poor behavior.

By using $AUDIO tokens as collateral, anyone with the proper hardware requirements can join as a
node operator in a completely permissionless fashion. The more $AUDIO staked to the protocol, the
more secure the network becomes and the less vulnerable it is to outside attacks.

As a reward for servicing the network, node operators stand to earn $AUDIO through the automatic
on-chain issuance, or the ongoing creation of new tokens distributed to value-added actors.

Those who stake more $AUDIO stand to earn a larger portion of issuance in exchange for securing the
network.

## Staking on Audius

To stake on Audius, node operators can set up content and/or discovery nodes using
[these resources](https://github.com/AudiusProject/audius-protocol/wiki/Staking-Resources).

A list of all active node operators can be found under the
[Services tab](https://dashboard.audius.org/services) in the Audius protocol dashboard.

$AUDIO holders can delegate a minimum of 100 tokens to any of these node operators by connecting to
either MetaMask or using a Gnosis Safe. More details on delegation will be released soon!

Node operators can choose to run either a Content Node, a Discovery Node or a combination of both.
The amount of $AUDIO staked to a given Operator can be thought of as their economic bandwidth to run
one or a combination of services on the network.

All node operators are required to post a **minimum self-bond of 200,000 $AUDIO tokens per node**.
While both Content and Discovery Nodes utilize the same machine, Content Nodes require more storage
and therefore cost slightly more to operate.

To this effect, the staking parameters of each node is as follows:

_Discovery Node_

- Minimum Bond (Stake): 200,000 AUDIO
- Maximum Bond (Stake): 7,000,000 AUDIO

_Content Node_

- Minimum Bond (Stake): 200,000 AUDIO
- Maximum Bond (Stake): 10,000,0000 AUDIO

The minimum stake ensures sufficient skin in the game, while the maximum prevents the protocol from
becoming too centralized. Content nodes have slightly higher minimum requirements, which is why they
are able to accept more stake than discovery nodes.

Each Operator is given a unique profile, allowing users to identify their address, timeline of
votes, and the different nodes they maintain. Other key parameters include:

- _Staked $AUDIO_ - The total amount of $AUDIO staked across all the operator’s nodes, measured as a
  combination of tokens staked or delegated to a given address.
- _Deployer Cut_ - The percentage of staking rewards that delegates pay to node operators for
  staking $AUDIO on their node. This is configurable by the node operator.
- _Services_ - The number of unique nodes run by a given operator.
- _Delegators_ - The total number of unique addresses delegating tokens to the Operator.

Node operators can also populate their information via [3Box](https://3box.io/), displaying a
profile image, title and website link to allow delegates to more easily distinguish themselves from
others on the network.

Audius features a 7 day cooldown period to undelegate or unstake in order to provide adequate time
for nodes to be slashed in the event of malicious behavior. During the genesis staking period, nodes
operated by the Audius foundation will have their Deployer Cut set to 100%, with all proceeds being
routed to a community treasury to be governed by $AUDIO tokenholders. These nodes will be retired in
the near future.

### $AUDIO Staking Rewards

Audius features a 7% automatic annual issuance rate distributed on-chain and on a weekly basis.
$AUDIO rewards are distributed directly on-chain to node operators, with the on-chain system
deducting their Delegator Cut and routing the remaining rewards to those who delegated their tokens.

Service providers are expected to run one transaction per week to distribute issuance for the
network, where tokens can be claimed in real time by individual node operators.

In the near future, $AUDIO issuance will begin to be computed from the call of the reward function.
Moving forward, anyone in the network can call the reward function, with tokens being distributed on
a weekly cadence and claimable at any time.

The rate, duration and parameters of $AUDIO staking are controlled entirely by governance.
