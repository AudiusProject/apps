/**
 * Returns a map of booleans that determine whether certain access fields are enabled.
 * This is based on whether the user is uploading a track or editing it.
 *
 * 1. Remixes cannot be gated tracks.
 * 2. During upload, all access options are enabled unless the track is marked as a remix,
 * in which case only Public and Hidden are enabled.
 * 3. During edit, rule of thumb is that gated tracks can only be modified to allow broader access.
 *    This means that gated tracks can only be made public.
 * 4. Hidden tracks may be gated or made public.
 *
 * NOTE: this logic is different from the logic using feature flags. to determine whether options should render or not; just whether or not they should be disabled
