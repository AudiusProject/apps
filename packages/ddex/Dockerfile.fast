# Attempting to build+push locally for a Linux (stage or prod) target may hang. Use this file as a workaround:
# 1. in packages/ddex/server: npm run build
# 2. in packages/ddex/client: npm run build
# 3. in docker-compose.ddex.yml, change the value of dockerfile from Dockerfile to Dockerfile.fast
# 4. run DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 audius-compose push --prod "ddex"
# 5. ssh into a stage node and edit ~/audius-docker-compose/discovery-provider/docker-compose.yml: change the ddex image to the SHA you just pushed
