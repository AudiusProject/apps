# legacy js files

These files are ported over from identity with minimal changes as they will likely get pulled out soon. This is to keep functional parity while also not going down types rabbit holes for code that we won't use long term.

All files should have a matching *.ts file that wraps the js in types to keep //@ts-ignores to a minimum.
