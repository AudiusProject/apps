## Use cases and examples

- Dividers should be used to provide a clear, visual separation between objects.
- Sometimes, dividers are applied in figma as a single stroke. Designers should ALWAYS apply that single stroke to the outside of the object and call out that the stroke is being used as a divider.
- Dividers are 1 px rectangles and therefore can sometimes fall off our 4px grid, but dividers should maintain our grid in terms of height and width.
