## Overview

#### Harmony's color palette is tailored for optimal usability and brand coherence.

## Primitives

Primitives include all the Harmony colors. They give a numeric name to our HEX values and are organized from lightest to darkest. Our “themes” or modes are defined at the primitive state and include: day (“default”), dark, and matrix mode.

### Static colors

Static colors remain the same across all appearance modes: Day, Dark, and Matrix.

### Primary

Primary is our brand color. It is used across our interface to represent elements with the highest importance. It defines the overall look and feel of Harmony.

<ColorPaletteTable colorType='primary' />

### Secondary

Supporting shades that work in tandem with primary colors to provide depth and hierarchy. These secondary colors are used for secondary actions or selection, while the primary color(s) should take precedence. Used for selected states and added emphasis.

<ColorPaletteTable colorType='secondary' />

### Neutral

Neutral is the foundation of the Harmony color system. Almost everything in our designs - text form fields, backgrounds, dividers - is neutral.

<ColorPaletteTable colorType='neutral' />

### Special

Specific shades designed for unique interface requirements, from accents to warnings

    gradient: 'Brand gradient'
  }}

## Semantic Variables

Functional color assignments for consistent UI guidance and feedback. Semantic color variables tell you when and how to apply colors.Functional color assignments for consistent UI guidance and feedback. Semantic color variables tell you when and how to apply colors.

### Text and icons

Semantic text-icon variables are used to keep all our text components clean and consistent. When a text component has an icon beside it, the icon’s fill should be the same as the text.

<ColorPaletteTable
  colorType='text'
  descriptions={{
    heading: 'Use for display text color',
    default: 'Use for default text color',
    subdued: 'Use for text with lesser importance',
    disabled: 'Use for text that is disabled'
  }}
/>

### Background

Semantic background variables are applied to the fill of any and all backgrounds in Harmony components.

<ColorPaletteTable
  colorType='background'
  descriptions={{
    default: 'default background color',
    white: 'Apply white to a card or container',
    surface1: 'Use for background surface',
    surface2: 'Use for background surface emphasis'
  }}
/>

### Border

Semantic border variables are applied to the exterior stroke of various elements. The strong variable should be applied when the stroke in on a colored background.

<ColorPaletteTable
  colorType='border'
  descriptions={{
    default: 'Use for default border color',
    strong: 'Use for border on color background'
  }}
/>

### Focus

Focus is used frequently as a secondary action color for things like selectable pills, links, radio buttons, inputs, etc. It should be applied to all active or focused states for components.

<ColorPaletteTable
  colorType='focus'
  descriptions={{
    focus: 'Use for focus states'
  }}
/>

### Status

Status colors are used to display status states: error, warning, and success.

<ColorPaletteTable
  colorType='status'
  descriptions={{
    error: 'Use for error states',
    warning: 'Use for warning states',
    success: 'Use for success states'
  }}
/>

## Usage and Examples

- Semantic variables should be used throughout your design. Avoid using primitives and #HEX values when possible.
- When text and icons are side-by-side they should have the same semantic color variable applied to them.
- **Border-strong** should be applied to elements on colored backgrounds.
- Focus should be used as the default for interactive elements.
- #FFFFFF should not exist in your designs.

### How to use background and "white"

- Use **background-default** to achieve our default background color in all modes.
- Use **background-white** when applying white to a card or container.
- Use **static-white** when you want white to remain white in all modes. (ex: ✓ in verified badge)
