# Reactotron Setup for Audius Mobile

Reactotron has been added to the Audius mobile app for enhanced debugging capabilities.

## Installation

Reactotron is already configured in the project. You just need to install the desktop app.

### Download Reactotron Desktop App

Download the desktop app from: https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron/releases

Choose the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

## Configuration

The configuration is already set up in `ReactotronConfig.js` with the following features:

- React Native plugins enabled
- AsyncStorage integration
- Network request monitoring (ignores symbolicate requests)
- Error tracking
- Custom app name: "Audius Mobile"

## Usage

### For iOS Simulator

1. Start the Reactotron desktop app
2. Run the mobile app with `npm run ios:dev`
3. Reactotron should automatically connect

### For Android Emulator/Device

1. Set up port forwarding (required for Android):
   ```bash
   adb reverse tcp:9090 tcp:9090
   ```
2. Start the Reactotron desktop app
3. Run the mobile app with `npm run android:dev`
4. Reactotron should connect

### For Physical iOS Device

1. Find your computer's IP address
2. Update `ReactotronConfig.js` and change `host: 'localhost'` to your IP address
3. Make sure your device and computer are on the same network
4. Start Reactotron and run the app
