# Fix Formik and Navigation Warnings in BuySellFlow - COMPLETE ✅

## Issues Fixed

1. **Formik context warning**: `ListSelectionScreen` → `FormScreen` → `useRevertOnCancel` → `useFormikContext()` expects Formik context, but none is provided when navigating to `CoinSelectScreen`

2. **Navigation serialization warning**: Passing functions (`onTokenChange`) through React Navigation params isn't supported and causes non-serializable values warning

## Solution: Modal-based Token Selection

Switched from navigation-based to modal-based token selection for better control and to avoid React Navigation serialization issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated TokenSelectButton to use Modal ✅ WORKING

- Replaced `navigation.navigate()` with local state management (`useState` for `isVisible`)
- Replaced Portal with React Native `Modal` component with `presentationStyle='pageSheet'`
- Wrapped `ListSelectionScreen` in the Modal for full-screen token selection
- Added proper event handlers (`handleTokenSelect`, `handleClose`)

### 2. Removed CoinSelectScreen from Navigation ✅

- Removed `CoinSelectScreen` route from `AppScreen.tsx`
- Deleted `/screens/coin-select-screen/` directory

### 3. Added TokenSelectItem Component ✅

- Created reusable `TokenSelectItem` component for consistent token display in lists
- Shows token icon, name, and symbol

## Why Modal Over Portal?

**Portal approach was initially attempted but abandoned because:**

- Required complex PortalHost setup at app level
- Conditional portal rendering was unreliable
- Added unnecessary complexity for simple modal behavior

**Modal approach is better because:**

- Simple and reliable React Native Modal API
- No additional setup required
- Proper modal presentation with `pageSheet` style
- Avoids navigation serialization warnings
- Avoids Formik context issues by not navigating to Formik-dependent screens

## Verification

✅ **Formik context warning**: Resolved - no navigation to Formik-dependent screens
✅ **Navigation serialization warning**: Resolved - no functions passed through navigation params
✅ **Token selection works**: Modal renders and allows token selection
✅ **Clean implementation**: Removed unused navigation routes and files
