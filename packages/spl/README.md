# `@audius/spl`

A Typescript package for creating and decoding Solana `TransactionInstruction`s for the Audius [Solana Programs](../../solana-programs/).

This is useful both for making Typescript/Javascript clients as well as for making indexers for the programs, and also lends itself to writing tests for indexers.

## Usage

See [solanaRelayTest.ts](../identity-service/test/routes/solanaRelayTest.ts) for example usages.
